# EmbeddedCodeGame
This was a project for my Embedded Systems class where I built a game using almost a multitude of peripherals off of the board we had. 

Was built in eclipse and includes the following peropherals: keypad, speaker, LCD, LED's, and rotary encoder.

This is a game in which the objective is to match the randomly generated codes and get 10 right codes in a row.
